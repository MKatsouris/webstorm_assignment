# online_shop
In this project I introduce a student online shop.

On the home page (index.html) you can observe the header with the university
logo, the name of the shop and the navigation tags which navigates you through 
the website. Moreover, there is o <h1> moto of the university and some words
about the student union. In addition, there are  two videos. The first is a video
element tag and the second video is a YouTube embed using iFrame. 
In the end there is  a footer split in three grids with more information about the 
UClan University.

On the product's page (products.html) you can clearly see the header and footer of
the shop. On this page there are displayed all products, (hoodies,jumpers,TShirts)
with their name, color, description of the product, price and the image of it.
All the buttons are in the beginning of the page with the details and add to cart 
functions.

On the item's page (item.html) you can clearly see the header and footer of the shop.
Also, the name, color, description of the product, price and the image of it.
You can navigate to this page by clicking the details button on the products page.
There is not a buy button in this page.

On the cart's page (cart.html) you can clearly see the header and footer of the shop.
You can only add items to this page by clicking the add to cart button on the products 
page.
